🧠 Project Overview
The AI Student Burnout Prediction System is a sophisticated machine learning solution designed to quantify and predict burnout levels among students by analyzing behavioral and academic data.

In an era of increasing academic pressure, this system serves as an early-warning mechanism. By identifying subtle patterns in student stress indicators, it empowers educators and mental health professionals to provide proactive, timely support before burnout reaches a critical stage.
